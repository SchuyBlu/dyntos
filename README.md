# Dyntos
Discord bot for the Kid Icarus: Uprising Multiplayer.

## Features
The bot has limited features, and the use case is pretty much exclusively limited to our discord server, but here they are:

## Installation
If for whatever reason you're wanting to run the bot yourself, there are a few things you'll need first.

You'll need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and include `pip` in your installation. The following will create a virtual environment for the application, with all it's dependencies. A virtual environment is required to allow for as much compatibility as possible across devices, as some will automatically adhere to `PEP 668`.
```
git clone https://github.com/SchuyBlu/dyntos.git
cd ./dyntos
mkdir Tests/logs
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You'll also need to create a [discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and give it the `bot`, `applications.commands`, and `Administrator` scopes. You'll need to generate a token for the bot and place it in a file named `.env` at the root of the project in this format:
```
TOKEN=<your-token-here>
```
With that, you can call `run.sh` if you're on some flavor of UNIX, or `python main.py` if you're on Windows.
